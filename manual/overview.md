# General Overview of the Project

The project is divided into three directories:

- `app` regrouping the backend of the solution.
- `front` regrouping the frontend of the solution.
- `tests` regrouping the tests of the solution.

## Backend

The directory is subdivised into:

- `app.js`: the main entry point of the application.
- `mappings`: the ElasticSearch mappings of the solution.
- `settings`: the ElasticSearch settings for each mapping.
- `config`: the general config of the solution (production, development, test).
- `initializations`: all the API routes needed by the backend to work.
- `logger.js`: the logger of the solution (based on Winston).
- `modules`: the main logic of the backend.
